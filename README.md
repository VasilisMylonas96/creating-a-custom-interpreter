# creating-a-custom-interpreter
Creating a custom interpreter using C involved four stages: lexical analysis, syntax
analysis, and execution. In the lexical analysis stage, the interpreter reads and identifies
the tokens in the input source code. In syntax analysis, the interpreter checks whether the
order and structure of the tokens are correct based on a predefined grammar. Finally, in
execution, the interpreter executes the program by interpreting each statement and
performing the necessary actions.
